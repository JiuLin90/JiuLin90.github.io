Teaching and learning is a dynamic process, so adjustment is required almost
 every single time.
 I am always willing to modify part of my teaching and adopt new already
 tested techniques into my course.
 This continuous adjustment encourages me to constantly reconsider the purpose
 and aims of the course and my teaching.
 Meanwhile, there are several key concepts that never change, such as engaging
 the students in the classroom, by group discussion, asking and answering
 questions; leading the students into undergraduate and even graduate level
 research projects (, as my published my first paper as a junior student).
 My ultimate goal is to cultivate the students necessary skills in problem
 solving, such as critical thinking and communication, and finally to guide
 the students into becoming self/independent math learners outside the classroom.

Carefully picked topics, examples and homework assignments.
 During the lecutes, I introduce and elaborate the basic concepts, e.g., theorems,
 formulas, etc., with certain examples.
 Then I select some homework problems that require the students to study
 one single formula or an example by themselves.
 The procedure is to encourage them to gradually learn some math and eventually
 become an independent learner.

, a standard editor to type math formulas and to generate PDF slides, to
 prepare the notes and slides.
 The slides only contains the theorems and the problem of examples without
 any solutions and they are shared before the lectures.
 Students can use the slides to preview; while the notes contains all details
 of solutions, including graphs.
 Students will devote more time in thinking the problem instead of only
 copying the notes; also it provides good resource for them to review.

 This is important as many job and graduate programs require the candidates
 to study some topics, including mathematics, independently.

After several years of experience in teaching, both as an assistant to lead
 the recitation sessions and an instructor, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every teacher was a student and some students will become teachers.
 Not until I became a teaching assistant and later an instructor of a course
 did I truly realize that teaching and learning are just counterparts of
 education.
 So it is essential to understand both parts during this process.
 Great teachers usually divide teaching into the following three concrete
 sub-roles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A motivator that inspires students.

 The good teacher explains.
 The superior teacher demonstrates.
 The great teacher inspires.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 A great teacher could turn the process of learning from passive receiving
 into active pursuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A trainer that sets up systematical plans and helps students accomplish.
 Math is accumulative, which is similar to building up muscles.
 Systematical plan of training could save time and result in better achievement.
 Thus, it is the role of the teacher to provide study plans, lecture notes
 and corresponding exercises for the students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A consultant for students after class.
 A doctor is needed when sickness happens.
 No one is more suitable than the instructor to analyze and solve students'
 problems, both concrete in exercises and general in study plans.

\begin_layout Standard
As my teaching experience increases, I also notice that a lot of details
 in teaching also contain counterparts.
 They behave as the two sides of the balance, though some pairs seem to
 be contradictory to each other.
 Compatibility of those pairs are the key to teaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
I.
 Group and Individuals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lectures are given for all the students.
 A suitable pace should allow the majority to follow.
 Group discussions on exercises are always recommended, provided that each
 individual could contribute, since it could reduce the difficulty and also
 increase each member's sense of accomplishment and identity.
 On the other hand, individuals have different problems, which is why the
 office hours for meeting individuals are necessary.
 After every midterm test, I require students to pick their test individually
 from my office so that discussions and analysis will follow individually.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
II.
 Limited Time and Scheduled Materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each lecture has limited time, which actually prevents students from getting
 tired and lost in the classroom.
 Thus, I arrange lecture notes carefully according to the time in order
 to make each lecture relatively integrated and also not hard to understand
 based on previous ones.
 Meanwhile, to save time, I always give handouts containing formulas, theorems
 and examples.
 For instance, some application problems in Calculus are very long, which
 is time-comsuming if rewritting them dowm completely.
 Such handouts, on the other hand, also provide me an opportunity to show
 the problem solving procedure.
 After class, notes are available for students to download, in order to
 prevent them from becoming

copiers

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, in stead of all the details, only key structures are
 provided in these notes, for maintaining the attandence and inciting thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
III.
 Abstract Theories and Concrete Examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To students, formulas and theorems in math are abstract, especially in higher
 level courses.
 Suitable examples can explain almost everything by visualizing the abstract
 theories.
 In my lectures, examples follow after every formulae and theorem.
 Moreover, classical examples usually appear multiple times, with or without
 slight modification, which is to help student understand, review, and memorize
 the materials.
 On the other hand, when reviewing for midterms and final exams, only abstract
 definitions, formulas and theorems are recalled to make a clear structure
 of the materials and also to emphasize the key points.

It is very fortunate that I have touched many different courses during my
 TA and teaching at Tulane University, where I graduated with my PhD diploma.
 For TA assignments, not only was I assigned for all Calculus I, II and
 III courses, but also for higher levels such as Experimental Mathematics,
 Combinatorics and, in particular, three times for Real Analysis.
 On the other hand, my teaching experience involves both various paces (
 regular pace for Calculus I, slower in Long Calculus II and faster in Consolida
ted Calculus which covers both Calculus I and II) and different time periods
 (Fall, Spring and Summer semesters).
 Meanwhile, substitution for instructors and colleagues is very common.
 Besides Calculus III, Real Analysis and Linear Algebra, I also have substitute
 to give lectures for a graduate level course Mathematical Physics for a
 week in Fall 2015.

\begin_layout Standard
Admittedly, I am far away from being a great teacher, but thank to all the
 great teachers I have met, for the clear path they have shown.
 As an old Chinese saying, both teacher and student could learn and benefit
 from the process of teaching.
 Some talks I attended show that a good research project can be inspired
 by students.
 Teaching is not alone, as learning being its counterpart, so is the pair
 of teachers and students.
 Every time when I enter the classroom for teaching, I knew we will end
 up with new ideas.
 I hope to learn everyday from my students during my teaching.
