This Chinese quote on teaching and learning reveals the mutual benefit between
 them.
 Although I read it as a teenager, not until 2014, when I first taught as
 an instructor, did I finally begin to better understand the nature and
 connections between teaching and learning.
 There are several key concepts, such as

motivation and inspiration, as William Arthur Ward said

The unique experience at DKU inspires me to dramatically shape and improve
 my teaching.
 In particularly, I took the following actions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang english
Detailed syllabus and topics for each lecture.
 This helps the students preview the material, so that they focus on the
 parts they had difficulty in understanding during the lecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang english
Carefully picked topics, examples and homework assignments.
 During the lecutes, I introduce and elaborate the basic concepts, e.g., theorems,
 formulas, etc., with certain examples.
 Then I select some homework problems that require the students to study
 one single formula or an example by themselves.
 The procedure is to encourage them to gradually learn some math and eventually
 become an independent learner.
\end_layout

Notes and Slides.

, a standard editor to type math formulas and to generate PDF slides, to
 prepare the notes and slides.
 The slides only contains the theorems and the problem of examples without
 any solutions and they are shared before the lectures.
 Students can use the slides to preview; while the notes contains all details
 of solutions, including graphs.
 Students will devote more time in thinking the problem instead of only
 copying the notes; also it provides good resource for them to review.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This is important as many job and graduate programs require the candidates
 to study some topics independently, which also applies to other majors,
 not only restricted to mathematics.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After several years of experience in teaching, both as an assistant to lead
 the recitation sessions and an instructor, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Every teacher was a student and some students will become teachers.
 Not until I became a teaching assistant and later an instructor of a course
 did I truly realize that teaching and learning are just counterparts of
 education.
 So it is essential to understand both parts during this process.
 Great teachers usually divide teaching into the following three concrete
 sub-roles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A motivator that inspires students.
 A great teacher could turn the process of learning from passive receiving
 into active pursuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A trainer that sets up systematical plans and helps students accomplish.
 Math is accumulative, which is similar to building up muscles.
 Systematical plan of training could save time and result in better achievement.
 Thus, it is the role of the teacher to provide study plans, lecture notes
 and corresponding exercises for the students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A consultant for students after class.
 A doctor is needed when sickness happens.
 No one is more suitable than the instructor to analyze and solve students'
 problems, both concrete in exercises and general in study plans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As my teaching experience increases, I also notice that a lot of details
 in teaching also contain counterparts.
 They behave as the two sides of the balance, though some pairs seem to
 be contradictory to each other.
 Compatibility of those pairs are the key to teaching.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Part*
Group and Individuals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Lectures are given for all the students.
 A suitable pace should allow the majority to follow.
 Group discussions on exercises are always recommended, provided that each
 individual could contribute, since it could reduce the difficulty and also
 increase each member's sense of accomplishment and identity.
 On the other hand, individuals have different problems, which is why the
 office hours for meeting individuals are necessary.
 After every midterm test, I require students to pick their test individually
 from my office so that discussions and analysis will follow individually.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
II.
 Limited Time and Scheduled Materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Each lecture has limited time, which actually prevents students from getting
 tired and lost in the classroom.
 Thus, I arrange lecture notes carefully according to the time in order
 to make each lecture relatively integrated and also not hard to understand
 based on previous ones.
 Meanwhile, to save time, I always give handouts containing formulas, theorems
 and examples.
 For instance, some application problems in Calculus are very long, which
 is time-comsuming if rewritting them dowm completely.
 Such handouts, on the other hand, also provide me an opportunity to show
 the problem solving procedure.
 After class, notes are available for students to download, in order to
 prevent them from becoming 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

copiers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, in stead of all the details, only key structures are
 provided in these notes, for maintaining the attendance and inciting thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
III.
 Abstract Theories and Concrete Examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To students, formulas and theorems in math are abstract, especially in higher
 level courses.
 Suitable examples can explain almost everything by visualizing the abstract
 theories.
 In my lectures, examples follow after every formulae and theorem.
 Moreover, classical examples usually appear multiple times, with or without
 slight modification, which is to help student understand, review, and memorize
 the materials.
 On the other hand, when reviewing for midterms and final exams, only abstract
 definitions, formulas and theorems are recalled to make a clear structure
 of the materials and also to emphasize the key points.

It is very fortunate that I have touched many different courses during my
 TA and teaching at Tulane University, where I graduated with my PhD diploma.
 For TA assignments, not only was I assigned for all Calculus I, II and
 III courses, but also for higher levels such as Experimental Mathematics,
 Combinatorics and, in particular, three times for Real Analysis.
 On the other hand, my teaching experience involves both various paces (
 regular pace for Calculus I, slower in Long Calculus II and faster in Consolida
ted Calculus which covers both Calculus I and II) and different time periods
 (Fall, Spring and Summer semesters).
 Meanwhile, substitution for instructors and colleagues is very common.
 Besides Calculus III, Real Analysis and Linear Algebra, I also have substitute
 to give lectures for a graduate level course Mathematical Physics for a
 week in Fall 2015.

Admittedly, I am far away from being a great teacher, but thank to all the
 great teachers I have met, for the clear path they have shown.
 As an old Chinese saying, both teacher and student could learn and benefit
 from the process of teaching.
 Some talks I attended show that a good research project can be inspired
 by students.
 Teaching is not alone, as learning being its counterpart, so is the pair
 of teachers and students.
 Every time when I enter the classroom for teaching, I knew we will end
 up with new ideas.
 I hope to learn everyday from my students during my teaching.

18 sections, of 10 different regular math courses, including various levels
 of calculus, linear algebra, probability, complex analysis, and number
 theory, at three different institutes;

 e.g., combinatorics, analytic number theory, quantum computing, and algebraic
 geometry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, for basic math courses, e.g.
 calculus, linear algebra, I have no preference, as all such courses are
 essential and important to students majoring in STEM.
 Meanwhile, as my research topics include several branches, such as combinatoric
s, (analytic and algebraic) number theory, etc., many advanced courses, e.g.,
 complex analysis, abstract algebra, also fit my area perfectly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take MATH301â€“Advanced Introduction to Probability at Duke Kunshan University
 (DKU) as an example.
 This course was designed by me upon my arrival at DKU.
 Many ingredients were taken into consideration, including but not restricted
 to the seven-week session structure at DKU, undergraduate curriculum, related
 major requirements, and other courses.
 The course serves as an elective in math major, and also consists of important
 materials for further courses, such as MATH405â€”Financial Mathematics.
 Some research topics, e.g., probabilistic methods, Shor's algorithms in quantum
 computing are also introduced as the very end of the class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Adjustment and Improvement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Teaching and learning is a dynamic process, so adjustment is required almost
 every single time.
 I am always willing to modify part of my teaching and adopt new already
 tested techniques into my course.
 This continuous adjustment encourages me to constantly reconsider the purpose
 and aims of the course and my teaching strategies.
 Moreover, comments on each course's evaluation are also helpful for improvement.
 The current average of the overall score and some comments show that I
 am a ``good teaching''; still, there is room and space be become a better
 instructor.

When COVID pandemic in 2020, online and hybrid teaching model become prevalent,
 hence necessary moves should be taken, in order to faciliate remote students.
 For instance, besides Zoom recordings, electronic lecture notes are uploaded
 after each lecture; office hours are offered both in person and online;
 tests are also altered from closed-book to open-book ones, etc.
 It is undoubtfully that teaching will not be the same as before 2019; since

 Research Project, awarded a grant of $2,000.
 Gradescope is a digital grading system that allows instructors to scan
 and upload exams, and to grade them online.
 It reduces the grading time for classes of large size and digitizes the
 tests.
 Right now, I am selected as a member of Faculty Learning Community (FLC)
 2022-2023, across all disciplines, to discuss and learn from each other
 in teaching.

\begin_layout Section
Technology and Innovation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Undoubtfully, the mostly common used software during pandemic online and
 hybrid teaching would be Zoom; however, the use of Zoom does not stop after
 switching back to in-person teaching: some functions are still beneficial.
 For instance, sharing via Zoom with allowing annotation for the whole class,
 largely engages students in questioning and discussions.
 As an instructor, any new technology and innovative methods attact me,
 though I am cautious in applying them.
 Once considered matured, such innovation will be carried out in my class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, I have successfully introduced MaxHub, WeBWorK, and
 Gradescope to my class.
 Besides, duirng Spring 2022, I completely used Mathematica

 as the platform for the course MATH201â€“Multivariable Calculus.
 More precisesly, all the lecture notes, slides, and some graphic animation
 are given in Mathematica.
 The power of graphics plotting perfectly matches the contents of the multivaria
ble calculus course, where many 3-dimensional graphs need to be visualized.
 Students manipulated the 3D plotting and animated some processes, such
 as the movement of a particle along a space curve.
 Assessment also includes a team based project in Mathematica.
