\begin_layout Standard
Mathematics is usually considered as the language of the universe, as its
 inclusive contents and objects.
 As a mathematician, it is natural and intrinsic to accept all possibilities.
 Although the content of mathematics leaves no room for, e.g., inequity and
 discrimination, it does not indicate that problems do not exist beyond
 it, such as racist, sexist, LGBTQ-phobic, ablest, etc.
 And both intentional and unintentional behaviors can be seen.
 Being aware of the differences, such as race, gender, nationality, disability,
 I am delightedly to contribute to the community on building a diverse society.

Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a Chinese student studying in the US, my PhD experiences gave me the
 lessons not only on culture shocks, but isolating and marginalized feelings,
 ice-breaking strategies, and developing communication skills.
 Therefore, in my teaching and research, and even daily life, I encourage
 all types of communications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional group work, group discussions can be a small but reliable step
 to break the ice among students in the classroom.
 Peer-reviewed presentations and Q&A sessions usually lead to a deeper and
 better mutual communication.
 I always work hard to guarantee an inclusive space, for students with various
 background and identities to freely express themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While in research projects, besides my collaboration with diverse groups
 of mathematicians, statisticians, and physicists, undergraduate students
 particularly are involved.
 Regardless the majors, identities, personalities of those students, the
 only factors to foster those collaborations are their enthusiasm, our common
 interests, and our contributions.
 While organizing seminars both at Dalhousie University and here at Duke
 Kunshan University (DKU), both undergraduate and graduate students are
 encouraged to present the latest progress, and valuable suggestions sometimes
 come from peers instead of instructors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would assume, as the Tea Time organizer during my PhD study at Tulane
 University, I already began to contribute to the community, on a harmonic
 environment for communication.
 Welcoming new students, bridging the gap between the faculty and students,
 as well as among students with different background, etc.
 are all achieved, by communication.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Accommodation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My several institutes, from PhD program to postdoc positions and now as
 a faculty, are all special and unique.
 Such special characters are not limited to the types: private university,
 public university, joint-venture liberal arts college, or a pure research
 institute; and regional disparities: US, Europe, Canada, and China.
 Such experiences require continuous adjustments and accommodation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am making every possible effort to accommodate students need, such as
 religious observances, disabilities, and both physical and mental health
 issues.
 Take my experiences at DKU, besides COVID-pandemic policies, I volunteered
 the training of the ``Adviser Program for Student Care''.
 Now as a peer adviser, we guide other faculty members, to take the first
 action on any unusual behavior of the students, and to refer them to the
 professional exports, such as counselors from Counseling and Psychological
 Services (CAPS).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In teaching, adjusting materials based on, e.g., majors, purposes, becomes
 part of my routine.
 Again, here at DKU, due to the special 7-week schedule, for calculus, we
 only have one week of lectures on applications of integration.
 Since last year, setting a survey becomes part of the teaching and different
 sections have completely different results and I enjoy satisfying the most
 of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
More Diverse Activities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diversity can mean a lot more.
 The abundant activities in teaching, academic events, campus life, can
 broaden students' understanding of the diverse paths to professional success,
 irrespective of identity or background.
 For instance, the public event: film screening of ``The Man Who Knew Infinity''
 successfully presents to all students the life of the legendary Indian
 mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.
 Guest speakers with different races, cultures, research interests and topics
 can offer the interactions served as eye-opening and empowering experiences
 for students.

\begin_layout Standard
I will remain committed to cultivating a collaborative academic community
 in which diversity is always appreciated, multiculturalism is recognized,
 and faith in social justice is sustained.
