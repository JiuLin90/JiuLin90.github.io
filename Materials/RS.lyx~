As random variables, we can consider the sum of independent and identically
 distributed (i.i.d.) sequence

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{i}\sim\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{i}\sim\mathcal{E}$

 Then, extensions on higher-order polynomials and Bernoulli-Barnes polynomials
 also admit symbolic expressions, which do not appear in traditional umbral
 calculus.

Orthogonal polynomials, Hankel determinants, and continued fractions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Admittedly, one does not need the probabilistic background, e.g., random variable,
 probability measure, moments, etc., to study orthogonal polynomials, Hankel
 determinants, continued fractions, weighted lattice path, generalized Motzkin
 number, and other related topics.
 Comprehensive introduction on basics and facts can be found, e.g., in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

.
 Personally, it IS the random variable interpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}^{(p)}(x)$

, Euler polynomials of higher-order defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, leading me to study the corresponding orthogonal polynomials, denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{n}^{(p)}(y)$
\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "20"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we recognize that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{n}^{(p)}(y)=i^{n}n!P_{n}^{(p/2)}\left(-i\left(y-x+\frac{p}{2}\right);\frac{\pi}{2}\right)/2^{n}$
\end_inset

, as the Meixner-Pollaczek polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}^{(\lambda)}(y;\phi)$
\end_inset

 (; see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

).
 Similarly, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\varrho_{n}(y)$
\end_inset

 be the the monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Bernoulli polynomia
l 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

, then we identify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varrho_{n}(y)=n!p_{n}\left(y;\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)/(n+1)_{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y;a,b,c,d)$
\end_inset

 is the continuous Hahn polynomial

.
 This work opens the door for me to continue on Hankel determinants, especially
 of sequences related to Bernoulli and Euler polynomials, due to the following
 two reasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The classical formula for calculating the monic orthogonal polynomials of
 a given sequence contains the Hankel determinants (, see, e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lemma 1 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "20"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 actually provides an alternative proof, in the aspect of random variables
 and orthogonal polynomials, that Hankel determinants are invariant under
 binomial transforms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "Item 445"
key "Muir"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 More precisely, the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 and its binomial transformed polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}(x):=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}c_{k}x^{n-k}$
\end_inset

 share the same Hankel determinants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, in recent years, I accomplished a series studies on Hankel determinan

\end_inset

, involving mainly Bernoulli and Euler polynomials, with their extensions,
 in, e.g., Dirchlet characters and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

-analogues.
 Besides major computations of new and important Hankel determinants, other
 highlights include the following.

 In the early work

 studies the uniform shuffling on

 cards, i.e., each result has probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n!$
\end_inset

 Then, merge the maximal consecutive integer subsequences and reduce the
 number of cards into the current remaining one.
 The model was introduced by Rao et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to model the number of times that catalysts must be added to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 molecules to bond into a single lump.
 The molecules have a given hierarchical order which led to the above mathematic
al formulation of the process.
 They studied the number of permutations needed for the process to end,
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

; and obtained the asymptotic behavior of the mean as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n\leq\mathbb{E}[X_{n}]\leq n+\sqrt{n}\Rightarrow\mathbb{E}[X_{n}]\sim n.
\]

\end_inset

Our work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 not only improved it by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X_{n}]=n+\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots\frac{1}{n-1}\right)+\varepsilon_{n},\quad\text{with}\quad0\leq\varepsilon_{n}-\varepsilon_{n+1}\leq\frac{1}{n^{2}},\label{eq:epsilon}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which also indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{n}$
\end_inset

 has a limit.
 More importantly, the simulation in

\begin_inset Formula $X_{2},\ldots,X_{100}$
\end_inset

 hinted that the asymptotic distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

 would tend to be normal.
 While, we completely solve it in the affirmative, i.e., we proved that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{X_{n}-n}{\sqrt{n}}\overset{w}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{N}(0,1),
\]

\end_inset

by estimating all the central moments of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$

, the Wishart distribution plays the essential rule, in defining the zonal
 polynomials and hence hypergeometric functions with matrix arguments.
 Alternatively, an equivalent definition of the zonal polynomials is the
 eigenfunction of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the space of symmetric,
 positive definite matrices.

\begin_layout Itemize
In the recent work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, we use the information geometry tools to study the exponential generalized
 beta of the second kind (EGB2) distribution or the beta-logistic distribution,
 with density function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x;\beta_{1},\beta_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{B\left(\beta_{1},\beta_{2}\right)}\cdot\frac{\exp\left(\beta_{1}x\right)}{(1+\exp(x))^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1},\beta_{2}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B(x,y)$
\end_inset

 is the beta function.
 With some simplification, it is not hard to recognize that this family
 include both densities for Bernoulli and Euler symbols

 Besides basic geometric structures, we also uncovers that the beta-logistic
 distribution admits an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, that has the potential for application in geometric statistical inference.

\begin_layout Section
Symbolic Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, computer or machine proofs, as the major aim in symbolic computation
, always contribute to mathematical proofs.
 For example, the WZ-method is applied in the proofs of

Multiple zeta value at non-positive integers

The multiple zeta function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta_{r}(n_{1},\dots,n_{r})=\sum_{k_{1},\dots,k_{r}>0}\frac{1}{k_{1}^{n_{1}}(k_{1}+k_{2})^{n_{2}}\cdots(k_{1}+\cdots+k_{r})^{n_{r}}}
\]

\end_inset

has more than one analytic continuations at non-positive integers.
 For instance, Sadaoui 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 used the Raabe's identity while Akiyama and Yanigawa

\end_inset

 considered the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula.
 Since both results involve Bernoulli number, applying Bernoulli symbol
 reveals, to our surprise, that both analytic continuations coincide.
 More precisely, for non-negative integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},\ldots,n_{k}$
\end_inset

, we have, symbolically, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{r}(-n_{1},\dots,-n_{r})=\prod_{k=1}^{r}(-1)^{n_{k}}\mathfrak{\mathcal{C}}_{1,\dots,k}^{n_{k}+1}\label{eq:MZV}

 For example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

the

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{-n_{1},\ldots,-n_{r}}(N):=\sum_{N>i_{1}>\cdots>i_{r}>0}i_{1}^{n_{1}}\cdots i_{r}^{n_{r}}=\prod_{k=1}^{r}\mathcal{H}_{1,\ldots,k}^{n_{k}},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{1}=\mathcal{H}(N)$
\end_inset

 and recursively 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{1,\ldots k}=\mathcal{H}\left(\mathcal{H}_{1,\ldots,k-1}\right)$

The method of brackets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of bracket is an efficient method for the evaluation of a large
 class of definite integrals on the half-line, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx,
\]

\end_inset

with only 6 simple rules, with applications to evaluate certain Feymann
 integrals, which arise from Feynman diagrams.
 In theoretical physics, a Feynman diagram is a pictorial representation
 of the mathematical expressions describing the behavior and interaction
 of subatomic particles.

My next plan is to combining the probabilistic method, i.e., exploring algorithms

 to modify or discover new, especially quantum, algorithms.
 The current plan is to begin with algorithms related to integer factorization,

 The main project is to implement the algorithm into a package in Mathematica

The ultimate goal is to study and explore the combination of quantum computing,
 algorithms, and symbolic computations.
 I am interested in the following important topics, due to their connections
 among different branches, and the potential applications in many unsolved
 problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Matrices: such as matrix representations of special functions, numbers.
 Note that quantum gates are represented by certain matrices, any result
 for those matrices is crucial to quantum computing.
 Besides, matrices in general are widely applied in, e.g., data science.
 My novel approach, by combining quantum computing and special functions
 brings new aspect in both directions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementation of Algorithms: including classical and quantum algorithms,
 so the platform can be Python, Mathematica, and Qiskit.
 Producing algorithm packages is always important in Experimental Mathematics.
 For instance, in my previous Research Institute for Symbolic Computations,
 PhD students are required to implement a package instead of publishing
 paper(s) in order to graduate.
 Another reason for this direction is, undergraduates students in math,
 computer science, and data science can participate and contribute, under
 my supervision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Differential Geometry: not only because I gained expertise in this during
 my master's study (see the next section), but also it is a well-know result
 that to find optimal quantum circuits is essentially equivalent to find
 the shortest path between two points in a certain curved geometry, i.e.,
 geodesics.
 This theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 interprets quantum gates under the frame of differential geometry.
 I am working on more practical algorithms, by largely following this algorithm,
 but with slight modification; in this way, we can improve the algorithm,
 by still using relative small number of gates, but dramatically reducing
 the time to find those gates.
